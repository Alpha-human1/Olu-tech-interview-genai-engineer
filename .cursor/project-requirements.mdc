# RAG Test Project Requirements

## Core Requirements

### Document Processing
- Process PowerPoint files containing economic research data
- Extract text content from slides, including titles, bullet points, and paragraphs
- Handle simple charts and graphs by extracting their titles and descriptions (if provided)
- Maintain associations between extracted text and its source slides/documents

### Vector Database
- Generate meaningful vector embeddings for extracted content
- Design and implement a database schema for storing:
  - Document metadata (file name, upload date, author, etc.)
  - Extracted text segments
  - Vector embeddings
  - Relationships between text segments and their source materials
- Implement efficient vector similarity search capabilities

### RAG Implementation
- Accept natural language queries from users
- Convert queries to vector embeddings
- Retrieve relevant content based on vector similarity
- Format retrieved context for submission to an LLM
- Generate coherent, context-aware responses using the LLM and retrieved information
- Implement a fallback mechanism when confidence is low

### User Interface
- Create a minimal chat interface similar to the reference design (legisimple.ca)
- Implement an input field for user queries
- Display chatbot responses with appropriate formatting
- Show basic attribution to source materials when possible

## Performance Expectations
- Return query responses within 5 seconds
- Handle at least 10 concurrent users

## Constraints
- The prototype must be deployable to Vercel
- Data must be stored in Supabase (or equivalent during development)
